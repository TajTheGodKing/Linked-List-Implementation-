# Linked-List-Implementation-
Fully functional Linked List implementation , 
  This includes an Add ,Delete, and Print Function This project is to show the simple understanding of how a linked list works without using the STL.
  -The Add function checks to see if the list is empty if so the "head" of the list is set with that data. 
  -The delete function insures that there arent any  holes in our list after deletion and is traced with another pointer to make sure of this. 
  -Last and not least our print function prints out the content of our Linked List until it reaches NULL
